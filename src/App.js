          <h2>Biochar</h2>
          <p>
            Biochar is a carbon-rich material produced by heating organic matter
            in a low-oxygen environment, a process known as pyrolysis. It has
            numerous environmental benefits, including...

          <p>
            <h2>Approach</h2>Carbon Capture and Storage by producing Biochar, a
            carbon-rich material produced by heating organic matter in a
            low-oxygen environment, a process known as pyrolysis. Combining
            Biochar with soil and compost can improve soil health, increase crop
            yields, and sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

            Renewable Energy, Clean Energy, Low Carbon Economy, Net Zero
            Emissions, Negative Emissions Due to the formula of C02, for every 1
            ton of Biochar produced, 3 tons of C02 are sequestered (Oxygen is
            heavier than Carbon and there are 2 Oxygen for every 1 Carbon in
            CO2)

            Biochar can be used for green energy production, carbon
            sequestration, and improving soil health.

          <p>
            It is an affordable and sustainable solution, making it an
            attractive option for combating climate change.
