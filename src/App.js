            lo-co2 is an Austin Texas based company that turns consumer waste
            into biochar, a carbon-rich material that sequesters carbon dioxide
            from the atmosphere. Our mission is to help combat climate change by
            providing an affordable and sustainable solution for carbon capture
            and storage.

            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <p>
              Because biochar is carbon negative, its production can be used to
              earn carbon credits. It also has many beneficial uses from
              improving soil health, increasing crop yields, and production of
              greener home goods and building materials. Biochar revolutionizes
              the carbon cycle by transforming waste into a valuable resource.
              Even when organic matter breaks down naturally, it still releases
              carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. Its called the carbon
              cycle for a reason. Converting organic waste into biochar locks up
              carbon for hundreds of years, and prevents it from being released
              into the atmosphere. It is a cost-effective
              and sustainable solution for carbon capture and storage. Trees and
              plants have already done the "Carbon Capture" for us through
              photosynthesis. Biochar handles the "Storage" part of Carbon
              Capture and Storage. We just lock up that carbon for the rest of
              our lives.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              Biochar is generated by heating organic matter in a low-oxygen
              environment, a process known as pyrolysis. Initially, we will
              focus on volume, diverting as much carbon waste into solid carbon
              as possible.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              We will start small, with a small pyrolysis unit that can process
              1 ton of organic waste per day. We will source organic waste from
              local businesses, schools, and households. We will also partner
              with local farmers to use biochar as a soil amendment. As we scale
              up, we will invest in larger pyrolysis units that can process
              larger volumes of organic waste.{" "}
            <p>
              We will source carbon waste from the City of Austin TX and local businesses using public and
              private sources for materials. We can help reduce landfill volume
              and help clean up the wastestream locally. We will cross promote
              our progress as a community. Every household in America generates
              5 pounds of trash a day and half of that is organic material that
              could become biochar. We want it.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              We will sell our carbon credits on Puro.Earth and other carbon
              credit marketplaces. We would also generate products from the
              biochar generated, from soil ammendments to green building
              materials.  Biochar production also has the
              incredible benefit of being able to generate green fuels packed
              with hydrogen.  While we are doing all of that
              we would continue to research best practices and look into scaling
              our operation across the USA. Every town can do this and we can
              help them get started. We would also look into creating a United
              States biochar standard and creating our own marketplace for
              credits and green products.

            <p>
              Carbon has thousands of industrial applications, including cement
              production, soil amendments, filtration, green building materials,
              carbon fiber, hydrogen production, and graphene. Biochar also
              reduces landfill volume and their associated methane emissions.
              Combining biochar with soil and compost enhances soil health and
              boosts crop yields. Carbon credits can be sold on the open market,
              generating revenue for the company and helping countries to meet
              their climate goals. The need for carbon sequestration is growing
              as the effects of climate change become more severe. Methane is 25
              times more potent than CO2 as a greenhouse gas. By diverting waste
              from landfills we stop the methane from forming. We can also
              generate green fuels and green energy from the gasses produced
              during the pyrolysis process. This is a great way to reduce our
              dependence on fossil fuels and reduce our carbon footprint.
              Biochar is a sustainable and cost-effective solution for carbon
              capture and storage.

          <div class="costs">
            <h2>Costs</h2>
            <p>
              The cost of producing Biochar is low compared to other carbon
              capture technologies. The main costs are associated with the
              collection and transportation of organic waste, the energy
              required to heat the waste, and the equipment needed to produce
              and store the Biochar.  The initial investment in a small
              pyrolysis unit that can process 1 ton of organic waste per day is
              estimated to be $100,000. As we scale up, we will invest in larger
              pyrolysis units that can process larger volumes of organic waste.
              In addition, the sale of carbon credits and other products generated
              from Biochar can help offset the initial investment.

            <h2>Competition</h2>
            <p>
              The other methods of carbon capture are expensive and require a
              lot of energy to operate. Over the past 20 years, promises have
              been made about reducing our carbon footprint, yet global
              emissions continue to rise. Clean Coal, Bioenergy with Carbon
              Capture and Storage, Direct Air Capture, and other technologies
              have been proposed as solutions to the climate crisis. However,
              these technologies are expensive, unproven, and have limited
              scalability. Biochar is a cost-effective, sustainable, and
              scalable solution for carbon capture and storage. It has the
              potential to revolutionize the way we think about waste and carbon
              sequestration.
